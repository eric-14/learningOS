In order to speed up the paging translation process,the CPU stores the most recently used page table entries in an internal cache, called the Translation lookaside Buffer(TLB)

Whenevr the page tables are changed, the OS kernel must flush the TLB to prevent it from using old page entries in the TLB.

Flushing th TLB can b done by reloading the CR3 control register.

Individual entries can be flushed by the INVPLG instruction 

FULL PAGING 
All pages of a process are allocated physical page frames.
After loading the process image into page frames the pages are always present.

In static paging each image is allocated a single piece if contiguos physical memory aligned to a page boundary.
The memory area is divided into a sequence of page frames which are used as page table entries.
Static paging is very easy to implement. Process images can be managed as variable-sized partitions by the simplest first-fit algorithm.
it is also very easy to construct the page tables since all the page frames are contiguos.

DEMAND PAGING 

The page tables of a process image are built by the image size, but not all the pages are allocated page frames.
This is th basis of virtual memory. Virtual memory can be bigger than the actual memory.

INTERRUPT HANDLING 

The first 32 interrupt vectors are reserved for exceptions 
The exception are no longer in the low 1KB MEMORRY area as in real mode.
Instead they are defined as interrupt descriptors in an interrupt descriptor table
