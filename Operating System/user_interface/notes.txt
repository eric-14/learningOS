System calls are divide into four groups.
Group 1 to group 3 are identical to Unix/linux system calls.The only exception is exec - used when a user enters a command line 

The entire command line is used in the exec system call but it passes the entire command lune to the new image wehn execution starts.
Parsing the command line into argc and argv is done by the startup code,crt0, in the new image.

The function main0() is in crt0.c, which is precompiled and installed in a mtxlib for linking.

main0.c(cjar *cmdLine){
    //parse cmdline as argv[0],argv[1],...,argv[n]

    //int argc = |<----------argc------------|

    main(argc,argv); //call main(), passing argc and argv

}

the main.c file. As usual, every user mode program can be written as 
#include "ucode.c"  //system call interface functions

main(int argc,char *argv[]){
    //main function of C program
}
