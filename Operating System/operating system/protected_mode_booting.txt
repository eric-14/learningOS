Hd-booter:
    During booting the hd-booter loadds BOOT + SETUP to 0x90000,
    APentry to 0x91000 and the MTX kernel to 0x10000. It also writes some boot parameters, such as Time-of-day(TOD)
    of BIOS, the boot device number and the start sector of the booter. 

    To the BOOT sector for the kernel to use. 
    Then it checks the boot signature at the end of the BOOT sector. 
    RR -  It jumps to 0x10000 to run MTX in 16-bit real mode. 
    PP - It jumps to 0x90200 to run SETUP, which brings up MTX in 32-bit mode.

SETUP - is a piece of 16-bit and 32-bit mode code in GCC assembly. It sets up an Intial GDT containing 4GB code and data segments and enters protected mode. 
    then it moves the MTX kernel to 1MB(0x1000) and jumps to the entry address of the MTX kernel.
