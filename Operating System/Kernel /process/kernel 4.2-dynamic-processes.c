---> when process must wait for something e,g a resource, identified by an event value it calls slepp(event) to go to sleep
---->An event is any value a process may sleep on as long as an another event willi ssue a wake up call on the event value
    it is up to the system designer to associate each resourec with a unoque evant value.
     for example when a process is waits for a child process termination it usually sleeps on its own on the specified PROC address which is uniqu and also known to uts children 
     when a process terminates it issues wake up (&parentPROC) to wake up its parent

-----> many processes may sleep on the same event which is natural beacuse many processes may need the same resource that is cuurentlu busy or unnavailable

-----> when an event occurs, someone will call wakeup event which wakes up all the processes sleeping on that event.if no process is sleeping on that event wakeup has no effect
    when an awekened process runs it musy try to get the resource again since the resource may already be obtained by another process

------> in a multiprocessor the sleep_first_wake_up later order cannot be guaranteed because process may run in parallel in real-time.
        in muliprocessor we need anothe process synchronization schemes e.g semaphores

-------> a process as it goes to sleep it is given a priority in the impartance the resource the process is waiting for.
            if awakened process has a higher priority than the current running process, process swith does not take place immediately . 
            it is deferred until the current running process is about to exit the kernel mode to return to user mode 


--------> The assigned priority classifies a sleeping process as either SOUND sleepr or a LIGHT sleeper. A sound sleeper can only be woken up by its awaited event.
        A sound sleeper can only be woken up by its awaited event. A light sleeper can be woken up by other means, which may not be event it is waiting for.
        For example, when a process waits for disk I/O, it sleeps with a high priority and should not be woken up signals. if it waits for an input key from a terminal which may not come for a long time.
        If it waits for an input key from a terminal, which may not come for a long time , it sleeps with a low priority and can be woken up by signals.

/*                     IMPLEMENTING SLEEP AND WAKE UP 
------>Modify the sleep function to enter the sleeping process into the sleepList.Modify the wake up sleeping processes in order

------> In the body() function, display sleeping processes and the events they are sleeping on

------>Instead of waking up all processes sleeping an event, wake up only one such process and discuss its implications
